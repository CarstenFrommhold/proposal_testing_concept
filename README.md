# Proposal 

This is a proposal to make it possible to develop code local and synchronise with an remote data storage (e.g. AWS s3).  
  
The advantage is that sample data is only available in the remote storages as well as locally and does not have to be shared among each other or included in the version control.  

To avoid accidental uploads to Git, the .gitignore can be customized.
